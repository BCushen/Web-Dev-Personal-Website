                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <p>Like most people I love to travel. My favourite place to travel is Asia. I've lived in Japan and travelled there extensively.
                    I've also visited Korea and visited Thailand. I plan in the future to take some time to travel China and hopefully
                    South East Asia at some stage. I also enjoy short city breaks in European coutries with Paris being my favourite destination.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>My musical taste is quite varied these days but having grown up in the '90s and '00s, I have a soft spot for '90s house
                    music. In the same vein I'm also a fan of techno. One of the acts I frequently listen to is the German duo FJAAK.</p>

                <h2>Science</h2>
                <p>I have always been passionate about science and am a big fan of science communication channels on Youtube, my favourite being Kurzgesagt.
                    Coming from a chemisty background, I have had some exposure to physics and hope some day to undertake a distance degree in physics with the
                    Open University as a personal interest.
