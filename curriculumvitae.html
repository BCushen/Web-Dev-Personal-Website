            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class = "cv_p">I am an experienced <strong><abbr title = "Analytical Research and Development">AR&D</abbr></strong> Scientist with extensive experience 
                         in a variety of roles in the <strong><abbr title = "Quality Control">QC</abbr></strong> laboratory environment across the pharmaceutical 
                         (<strong>small molecule and biopharmaceuticals</strong>) and medical devices sectors. I have strong skills in problem-solving and troubleshooting 
                        for <strong>analytical chemical and biochemical analysis</strong>, particularly in the field of analysis of <strong>monoclonal antibodies</strong>.
                         I maintain a strong aptitude for and knowledge of the underlying <strong>measurement principles of analytical methods</strong>. Furthermore, I have also
                        worked in manufacturing process support roles where I gained a deep understanding of <strong>cell culture</strong> and <strong>downstream 
                        protein purification</strong>.

            <h2>Future Direction</h2>
            <p class = "cv_p">I am currently enrolled in a <strong>Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Conversion)</strong> at UCD. My goal with this course is to
                acquire a new skill set that I can use in digital roles in the pharmaceutical industry with a particular interest in the
                areas of digital solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturing (e.g. <abbr title="Electronic Batch Record">EBR</abbr>, <abbr title="Chromatography Data Systems">CDS</abbr>, 
                <abbr title="Lab Information Management Systems">LIMS</abbr>  and process automation.)<br>
