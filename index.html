                <p> My name is <b>Brian Cushen</b> and I am currently a <b>graduate student</b> in UCD
                    studying towards a <b>Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Conversion)</b>. This webpage has been created as part of an 
                    assignment for <b>Module COMP30680 "Web Application Development.</b>" The intent of this website is to serve as a demonstration
                    of usage of the <b>HTML and CSS</b> content covered in the early weeks of the course. <br><br>
                    It also details my <b>professional experience</b> and <b>academic background</b> to serve as a CV of sorts. Since studying <b>chemistry and biochemistry</b> at university
                    I have mainly worked in the <b>pharmaceutical and medical devices industry</b> both in Ireland and Japan. Recently, however with the ongoing <b>automation
                    and digitisation of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes</b> I have become interested in learning more about computer science and how I can apply it
                    in my field. Who, knows? I may even make a career change to the tech industry proper. <br><br>
                    But it's not all dull stuff! I've included a gallery page with some <b>photos
                    from travels and my time living abroad </b> and also a personal page where I share some of my personal interests (e.g. hobbies, musical taste etc.)
